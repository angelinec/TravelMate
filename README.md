## <b>Overview</b>

This is an almost 2-year-old prototype app that is no longer maintained. Last source code edit made was in May 2015.

Certain functionalities require a Google API key to work. I have removed my personal API key. Therefore, please insert your own API key in the AndroidManifest.xml file if you wish to test those functionalities.

Specifically in this section:
```
            <meta-data
              android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
              android:value=" " /> <!--ENTER YOUR API KEY-->
```
